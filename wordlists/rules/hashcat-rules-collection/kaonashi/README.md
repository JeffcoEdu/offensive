![current version 20190503](https://img.shields.io/badge/current%20version-20190503-blue.svg)

There are three families of rules:

1. Yubaba: Rules created by static analysis of leaked passwords. These rules
   are very basic and work well with word-based dictionaries.
2. Haku: Rules created by cracking (see presentation slides!), using a
   word-based dictionary as base.
3. Kamaji: Rules created by cracking, using a password-based dictionary as
   base.
