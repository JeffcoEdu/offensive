Upon connecting to the VPN we can observe a few things.

The first observation being our assigned tun0 interface IPv4 address:
```
$ ifconfig tun0

tun0: flags=4305<UP,POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,NOARP,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 10.1.1.2  netmask 255.255.255.0  destination 10.1.1.2
        inet6 fe80::4309:35dc:eaa7:85cd  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>
        unspec 00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00  txqueuelen 500  (UNSPEC)
        RX packets 8  bytes 853 (853.0 B)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 47  bytes 5690 (5.5 KiB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
```

The second being our local machines new routing table:
```
$ route    

Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface

<snip>
10.10.12.0      10.1.1.1        255.255.255.0   UG    0      0        0 tun0
<snip>

```

This gives us enough information to get started. We will begin by doing an nmap ping sweep and only display hosts that have open ports.

```
$ sudo nmap -PE -sn --open --min-rate 2000 --top-ports 100 10.10.12.* -oG ping.sweep.10.10.12.0 -vvvvv

```

Looks like we've got a few alive hosts, this should be enough to get us started. We will add them into a file and then use nmaps `-iL` flag.

```
$ vim hosts.txt
10.10.12.25
10.10.12.100
10.10.12.101
10.10.12.105

:!wq

$ cat hosts.txt
10.10.12.25
10.10.12.100
10.10.12.101
10.10.12.105
```

Now that we've got our list of hosts created, we will perform further invasive scanning.
`-n` skips dns resolution, speeding up the scan.
`-Pn` skips host discovery, speeding up the scan

```
$ nmap -iL hosts.txt --top-ports 250 -n -Pn -sC -sV --min-rate 2000 -vvvv -oG top.250.ports.sv.sc.10.10.12.0

Lets get metasploit going.
